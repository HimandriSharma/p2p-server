# P2P Messaging App

A decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging application built using Node.js. The app allows users to communicate across a distributed network of servers, with no central authority. Each server in the network maintains a list of peers, enabling users to lookup and communicate with each other once they come online.

## Features

- **Decentralized**: No central server; each instance serves as a node in the network.
  
- **Peer Discovery**: Each server maintains a list of peers, allowing users to find other registered users.
  Dynamic Peer Registration: Users register on the network and are discoverable as soon as they go online.
  Scalable: Add as many servers as needed, with each instance communicating with other instances to share network information.

## Prerequisites

```
Node.js (>= 14.x.x)
NPM or Yarn
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:HimandriSharma/p2p-server.git
   cd p2p-messaging-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up the seed server list in seed.ts.

4. Start multiple server instances to simulate a P2P network. Each instance must run on a different port:

    ```
    PORT=3000 yarn start
    PORT=3001 yarn start
    PORT=3002 yarn start
    ```

## Usage
- **Run the servers**: Start each instance with a unique port as shown above.

- **Registering Users**: When a user connects, they are registered on the network, becoming discoverable to other peers.

- **Sending Messages**: Users can look up other registered users' IP addresses by querying the network.
Once a userâ€™s IP is found, messages can be sent directly between peers.
